* Note that you must enter a real combination for a 2x2 Rubik's Cube in order for the application to work.
* The application will output a series of letters which notate specific turns on the Rubik's Cube. Completing the series of turns will solve the Rubik's Cube.

The files in this folder contain everything you need to run your app in the Code.org app lab environment:

  javascript that applab uses to run your app.

  your app. Go here to add additional controls to your app.

* `style.css` - This file defines the custom styling for each control in your
  app that you specified under the Design tab. Go here to change the colors,
  positions, dimensions, and other properties of your app's controls.

* `code.js` - This file has all the code you wrote for your app. Go here to add
  new behavior to your app.
